# 30
Just thirty minutes on the clock

Exactly thirty minutes per playthrough. (Might shorten this to 20 or 15, depending on how design goes, or maybe lengthened)

Real-time collapsing world.

2D physics engine. Must guarantee deterministic behaviour.

Puzzles that must be solved before their keys disappear or the room collapses. Hints that may be found in the wreckage. Game continues even if a puzzle is unsolved -- an exit is made accessible through collapse.

Story elements that can only be found in the ruins.

NPCs affected by the collapse, affecting later puzzles, if they live.

A true ending (which exists so players can know they've reached the end) requires reaching and solving a final puzzle; some failures may be required along the way. The true ending will leave questions unanswered, though, making a walkthrough-based run unsatisfying; the answers require traversing through failure cases. There may be cause to borrow from 999 or Zero Escape here, in terms of giving the player's character knowledge only the player would know from having seen other paths.

All story told through dynamic narration, depending on the state of a room when the player arrives and the player's (in)actions within. The Stanley Parable is the current reference for this model.

All gameplay occurs along a single, continuous level. Backtracking is gated by collapse; the next section is pre-loaded as needed.

All puzzles must be skippable by triggering failure. This will buy more time in the next section; all terminal points have a failure option that immediately ends the game.

Puzzles may be quasi-open-world or locked-room. Likely a mix. Likely with some puzzles that don't even reveal themselves to be puzzles and would just be overlooked until subsequent playthroughs.

Previously solved puzzles (locked-room-style) may be skipped; this accelerates the clock by the same amount of time as the last  solution required. This may not always be ideal, because a clue or tool may be present in the chamber and required (or to be left alone); the state of any such things will be the same as the last solution. Similarly, if the player has learned or obtained anything that could change the outcome of the puzzle, they may want to act on it. (If the player lacks an item required for an alternate solution, the basic one is executed instead, based on previous solution data)

Some items in the world may persist between playthroughs; tears in the fabric of time might be a plot conceit, or maybe some objects needed to open alternate paths (but without other impacts) stay in place as a convenience.MAGICAL, GLOWY, TIMEY-WIMEY CRATES!
